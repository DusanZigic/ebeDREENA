ebeDREENA is computational framework for generating high-pT predictions based on a dynamical energy loss formalism. The framework can include any, in principle arbitrary, event-by-event fluctuating temperature evolution within the dynamical energy loss formalism. This version is generalized to account for both LHC and RHIC energies and collision systems.

## < 1 > compilation

Compilation of the source code, performed using gcc compiler:

g++ source/*.cpp -fopenmp -O3 -o ebeDREENA

a) -fopenmp is necessary to enable parallelization using OpenMP;  
b) -O3 optimization is not necessary, but recommended;  
c) -o DREENAA is optional and if omitted, the output of the compilation will be placed in a.out;  

## < 2 > prerequisite files

All prerequisite files need to be textual tables or binary files. Textual tables can have a different number of columns depending on the file and they can contain header lines that start with '#' symbol;  

### a) initial pT distributions  
initial pT distributions file should have 2 columns in format: pT | dsigma/d(pT^2);
for heavy flavor, initial pT distributions can be obtained from http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~cacciari/fonll/fonllform.html;  
IMPORTANT: note that the default output of this web interface is dsigma/dpT, while ebeDREENA initial pT distribution input needs to be dsigma/d(pT^2), so these distributions need to be modified; to avoid modifying different parameters that are hard-coded, initial pT distribution for heavy flavour should be in the range of 1GeV to at least 200GeV and for light flavour from 1GeV to at least 450GeV; for most distributions pT step of 1GeV seems to be sufficient;  
initial pT distribution file path relative to the executable should be: ./pTDists/ptDists[sNN]/ptDist_[sNN]_[particleName].dat, where [sNN] is collision energy that can be 200GeV, 2760GeV, 5020GeV and [particleName] is the name of the particle that can be Bottom, Charm, Down, DownBar, Gluon, Strange, Up, UpBar;  

### b) temperature evolutions  
temperature evolution files should be in binary format as 32bit floating point numbers;  
temperature evolution file path relative to the executable should be: ./evols/evols_cent=[centrality]/tempevol[eventID].dat, where [centrality] is centrality parameter in format 'xx-xx%' (ie 0-5%, 10-20%,...), and [eventID] is non negative integer that represents event's ID;  
within this repository there is an example temperature evolution file generated evolving Monte Carlo Glauber initial condition with 3D hydro for 5020GeV Pb+Pb collision (see arxiv:2208.09886 for more details);

### c) temperature evolution grid parameters file  
temperature evolution grid parameters file is located in the same directory as the temperature evolution files: ./evols/evols_cent=[centrality]/evolgridparams.dat, where [centrality] is centrality parameter in format 'xx-xx%' (ie 0-5%, 10-20%,...);  
this file contains temperature evolution grid parameters sush as tau0, x and y grid ranges and steps;  
this format for evolutions is chosen to save storage space and import time;
within this repository there is an example temperature evolution grid parameter file that corresponds to provided temperature evolution;

### d) binary collision points  
binary collision points path relative to the executable should be: ./binarycollpts/binarycollpts_cent=[centrality]/binarycollpts[eventID].dat, where [centrality] is centrality parameter in format 'xx-xx%' (ie 0-5%, 10-20%,...), and [eventID] is non negative integer that represents event's ID;  
binary collision points are generated by initial condition model and are used to generate jet's initial positions in x-y plane, while direction angles are uniformly distributed;  
within this repository there is an example of binary collision points file generated using Monte Carlo Glauber initial condition model, and the same initial conditions are evolved to generate temperature evolution provided in this repository (see arxiv:2208.09886 for more details);  

### e) LTables  
LTables files contain pre-generated radiated gluon rates and collisional energy loss; for radiative energy loss, there are 2 tables LNorm table with column format: tau | p | temp | LNorm and Ldndx table with column format: tau | p | temp | x | Ldndx; these tables are also a function of particle mass (particle name is in file name), chromo-magnetic to electric mass ratio, xB, (xB value is in file names) and effective number of flavours, nf (nf is in file name and depends of collision energy: nf=2.5 for 200GeV and nf=3.0 for LHC energies);  
for collisional energy loss, there is one table LColl with column format: p | temp | LColl; this table is also a function of particle mass (particle name is in file name) and effective number of flavours, nf;  
LTables files path relative to the executable should be: ./ltables/lnorm_nf=[nf]\_[particleName]\_xB=[xB].dat, ./ltables/ldndx_nf=[nf]\_[particleName]\_xB=[xB].dat, ./ltables/lcoll_nf=[nf]_[particleName].dat, where [nf] is the effective number of flavours that can be 2.5 for 200GeV or 3.0 for LHC energy collisions, [particleName] is the name of the particle that can be Bottom, Charm, LQuarks or Gluon (all light quarks are taken to have same mass, so their LTables are the same), and [xB] is the chromo-magnetic to electric mass ratio;  
unlike previous files, ebeDREENA calculates LTables; however, these tables need to be calculated only once and can be reused while calculating high-pT energy loss with different temperature evolution backgrounds;
within this repository there is an example of LTables files for Charm quark, nf=3.0 and xB=0.6;  

### d) phiGausPts  
in ./phiGaussPts/ directory are textual tables containing jet's direction angles and weights that correspond to Gaussian quadrature integration method in range [0, 2Pi];  
jet's direction angles are sampled in these points, so that afterwards, when integrating final pT,phi distribution over phi, which is nedeed to obtain R_AA, v_2, v_3,..., there is no need for angle resampling;

## < 3 > running ebeDREENA  
There are two possible calculation options within ebeDREENA framework: LTables calculation and energy loss calculation. Since ebeDREENA is parallelized using OpenMP, set OMP_NUM_THREADS environmental variable to desired value before running calculations.

### a) LTables calculation  
to perform basic LTables calculation use command: ./ebeDREENA LTables --sNN=[sNN] --pName=[particleName] --xB=[xB]  
-**sNN** parameter: case sensitive string with possible options: 200GeV, 2760GeV, 5020GeV, 5440GeV;  
-**particleName** parameter: case sensitive string with possible options: Bottom, Charm, LQuarks, Gluon, where LQuarks stand for light quarks, since all light quarks (down, down-bar, strange, strange-bar, up and up-bar) use the same LTables;  
-**xB** parameter: float that represents magnetic to electric mass ratio; based on lattice calculation: xB=0.6;  
for example, to calculate LTables for charm quark for 5020GeV LHC collision and for xB=0.6, which are LTables provided in this demo, command should be: ./ebeDREENA LTables --sNN=5020GeV --pName=Charm --xB=0.6;  
additional parameters are number of points used for QuasiMonteCarlo integration LdndxMaxPoints and LCollMaxPoints;  
to see all available parameters for LTables calculation and their default values use: ./ebeDREENA LTables -h;  

### b) energy loss calculation  
to perform basic energy loss calculation use command: ./ebeDREENA AverageEL --collsys=[collisionSystem] --sNN=[sNN] --pName=[particleName] --centrality=[centrality] --xB=[xB] --eventN=[numberOfEvents] --BCPP=[bcpPercentage] --phiGridN=[numberOfAngles]  
-**collisionSystem** parameter: case sensitive string with possible options: AuAu, PbPb, XeXe,...  
-**sNN** parameter: case sensitive string with possible options: 200GeV, 2760GeV, 5020GeV, 5440GeV;  
-**particleName** parameter: case sensitive string with possible options: Bottom, Charm, Gluon, Down, DownBar, Strange, Up, UpBar, LQuarks;  
 the calculation can be done for each parton individualy, however there is an option to calculate all light quarks at the same time using modified algorithm since the only thing differentiating light quarks is initial pT distribution; this leads to 4x speed-up of the calculation time compared to calculationg each light quark individually;  
-**centrality** parameter: string in format 'xx-xx%' (ie 0-5%, 10-20%,...);  
-**xB** parameter: float that represents magnetic to electric mass ratio; based on lattice calculation: xB=0.6;  
-**numberOfEvents** parameter: non-negative integer representing number of events;  
number of binary collision points and temperature evolutions should match this number; event loop goes from 0 up to not including numberOfEvents;  
-**bcpPercentage** parameter: string representing binary collision points percentage, for example 20%;  
this parameter determines the percentage of binary collision points that will be used as jet's initial points, meaning that events with larger number of binary collisions will have more jet's since the percentage is the same;  
-**numberOfAngles** parameter: non-negative integer representing number of jet's direction angles;  
for each initial position, numberOfAngles jets are generated;  
based on numberOfAngles parameter, angle values are imported from ./phiGaussPts/phiptsgauss[numberOfAngles].dat  
additional parameters are:  
-**TIMESTEP** parameter: positive float, that represents the timestep of jet traversing qgp medium;  
-**TCRIT** parameter: positive float, that represents critical temperature, i.e. the temperature value for which the energy loss stops;  
-**BCPSEED** parameter: non-negative integer that represents seed for random engine that samples binary collision points as jet's initial positions;  
 when set to 0, no seed is set and every run will produce different results;
 to see all available parameters for energy loss calculation and their default values use: ./ebeDREENA AverageEL -h;  

## < 4 > outputs of ebeDREENA  
Output of LTables run is in ./ltables/ directory; for single run, there are three output files - two for radiative and one for collisional. These tables are determined by effective number of flavours, i.e. collision energy, particle type and the value of xB. These tables are necessary for energy loss calculations and they are reused for different different events, centralitites hydro backgrounds obtained with different models,... As an example, tables for charm quark are given for LHC collision energy and for xB value of 0.6.  

Output of energy loss run is in ./results/results[particleName]/, where particleName can be Bottom, Charm, Down, DownBar, Gluon, Strange, Up, UpBar. These are R_AA(pT,phi) distributions that are later used to calculate R_AA and v_n. These files also have headers, that contain various informations about the event such as event ID, value of xB, average jet path-length,... For file name pattern see file provided in this repository.  
R_AA(pT,phi) distribution provided in ./results/resultsCharm/ is generated using initial pT distribution obtained from http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~cacciari/fonll/fonllform.html, as well as binary collision points, temperature evolution and ltables provided in this repository with all default parameter values except BCPSEED, which is set to 1, so that users can check if they get the same results.  

## < 5 > disclaimer  
This version of the ebeDREENA framework is meant for high-pT energy loss calculation on event-by-event fluctuating hydro background.  
ebeDREENA framework provides results for bare quarks and gluons. To obtain results comparable to experimental data, fragmentation functions such as DSS, BCFY and KLP have to be used.  
Calculation time for LTables calculation is large (up to about hour and a half on 112 cores), however, they need to be calculated only once. Energy loss calculatio time for single event on single core is up to about 3 minutes, however calculation time vary for different particles.
